        <p class="edittext">Quezon City’s mayor, Joy Belmonte, together with QC Gender and Development (GAD), conducted a Commitment Ceremony for its LGBTQIA+ citizens last February 14, 2023. This is the second time they will organize such a celebration, showing that QC is a gender-free community where everyone is treated with utmost respect and equality. This major step forward from the Local Government Unit (LGU) should prompt the National government to make progress on equality legislations that are already long overdue, including The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression Equality Bill (SOGIE Bill) and the Civil Union or Partnership among the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>
        <p class="edittext">Senate Bill No. 449, introduced by Senator Robinhood Padilla, seeks to give same-sex couples the opportunity to be recognized in the Philippines without prejudice by giving them basic protection through the passing of the said bill. Considering the current provisions of the Family Code, Padilla’s proposal primarily emphasized the importance of equality, regardless of the person’s sexual orientation and gender identity. It is also stated that as of December 2021, 31 countries have already legalized the recognition of civil unions. Taiwan is the first Asian country to do so, while six cities in Japan are issuing partnership certificates to recognize same-sex couples in their region.</p>
        <p class="edittext">In addition, senators who favor legalizing the Civil Union emphasized that the bill would just allow more people to be legally recognized by the state and would not result in any kind of injustice towards straight couples. Should this bill be enacted as a law, same-sex couples will not just experience less judgment from those around them. Still, they will also be given the same benefits and privileges that heterosexual couples currently possess. Some of those rights include child adoption, spousal support, health and pension benefits, and even recognizing the partner’s decisions in making burial arrangements.</p>
        <p class="edittext">Moreover, according to a survey conducted last May 2019 by CNN Philippines, 41% of the respondents favor the legalization of same-sex unions. Based on this number, we can presume that Filipinos also wish to have a community that fully accepts the existence of different genders and sexuality. </p>
        <p class="edittext">Therefore, the Senate should discuss the premises of the aforementioned bills, not just for the sake of the minority but to ensure that all Filipinos are given equal rights and opportunities to love freely without being discriminated against. </p>
        <p class="edittext">Lastly, as citizens, we should keep ourselves knowledgeable, open-minded, and more sensitive toward the people around us. Homosexuality should be acknowledged and accepted rather than treated as a disease that needs to be cured or an issue that needs a resolution.</p>
