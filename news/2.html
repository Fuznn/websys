			Well… Well…
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			What a beautiful assemblage, Tytana. As the cheers of the teachers mingled along with the students’ continual reverberation of joy around the walls, the echoes of their heartbeat united as one. I must say, my heart quipped in delight at receiving an invitation. In honor of this joyous occasion, I shall bestow my gift upon the Titans. Listen well, all of you. The Titans shall grow in grace and beauty, beloved by all who meet them. However, on the 16th day of November, they will fall into a deep sleep and wake up as their desired character from a book! 
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			An air of anticipation and giddy excitement wafts through the air for what lies ahead. They serve as witnesses to the cascading series of events, united by their shared experiences. This invitation not only marks an event but also the beginning of what looks to be a harmonious journey for us, the Titans. 
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			Speaking of which, the event is a testament to Tytana's 6Cs in commitment to creative learning, which recognizes the power of imaginative expression, and that includes fostering a love for reading! Rather than just simply discussing stories in books, students walked in the shoes of literary figures, dressing in meticulously made costumes and capturing the spirit of their chosen characters.
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			In addition to the visual extravaganza, the celebration also included literary-related activities such as a freedom wall to pin book recommendations and an available photo booth. However, the highlight of the event was the LitFab (Literary Fabulous) 2023, handled by The English Club (TEC) and hosted by their members, Mr. Nathan Nuñez and Ms. Denise-Lyn Dueñas, wherein the representatives of each section showcased their costumes and acted according to the character that they were dressing up.
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			Furthermore, the emcees interact with the assembly while the show is ongoing, engaging the audience with short Q&A sessions. Their engagement delved into the audience's preparations, the stories behind their character choices, and their view of the overall experience of cosplaying a literary icon for a day! It served not just to pass the time but as an exchange of passions and interests, creating a sense of unity to share the revolving magic world of literature.
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			As the day came to an end, much like a novel closing its book, the buzzing energy is slowly replaced by the tranquility of students admiring each other’s work and efforts. Kudos and words of praise were thrown around, appreciation swelling up in their chests and surely lighting a fuse in the hearts of the students. Their eyes gleamed in ecstasy as ideas jammed their minds for what kind of preparations they should make for next year. 
		</p>

		<p class="edittext">
			The celebration of National Reading Month at Manila Tytana Colleges through the power of cosplay not only showed the school's encouragement to foster a love for reading but also presented a profound impact of creativity and imagination in an educational setting, fulfilling the Titan's saying: "Natuto ka na, Nag-enjoy ka pa!"
